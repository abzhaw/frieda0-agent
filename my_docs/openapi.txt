{"openapi":"3.0.2","info":{"title":"Scite API","description":"The scite.ai API gives access to citation data, scite tallies, related paper metadata, and scite reference check.\n\nWe do not provide API clients but you can generate them using the OpenAPI spec above.\n\n# Terms of Use\n\nTerms of use for the scite API can be [found here](https://scite.ai/apiterms).\n\n# Overview & Terminology\n\n| Target and Source | In our API, we refer to the source as the publication making the  citation and the target as the publication receiving the citation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Tallies           | Tallies are counts of citations for a particular target including how  much a publication has been supported, contradicted, or mentioned. The counts for `total`, `supporting`, `contradicting`, `mentioning` and `unclassified` reflect the number of citation statements made toward the DOI. The count `citingPublications` reflects the number of distinct publications which cite the DOI. This distinction is important because there can be more than one citation statement from a publication. Please note, in our UI and other places we refer to contradicted as contrasted but in our API we refer to it as contradicted. |\n| Papers            | Papers are the metadata about publications including basic things such  as DOI, title, date of publication and more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Search*           | The search API allows querying scite's publication metadata and citation data. Citation sources can be queried both by publication metadata such as year, journal and so on, as well as the content of their citation snippets and where/how they occur.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Reference Check*  | We provide an API for our reference checking capability where a  publication can be submitted and its references can be evaluated and  linked using scite's data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| References*       | In our API 'references' refers to what are traditionally called 'citations'.

and structural connectivity of the amygdala underpins locus of control in mild cognitive impairment","abstract":"Locus of control (LOC) is an important personality trait. LOC over cognitive competency reflects an individual's perceived control of desired cognitive outcomes, which is critical for maintaining successful cognitive aging. It is important to understand the neural substrates of LOC over cognitive competency in older adults, especially for individuals at high risk of dementia. Here, we characterized a cohesive functional and structural connectivity profile underlying LOC among 55 older adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), combining resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging. The results showed that both functional and structural connectivity between the medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala were significantly correlated with external LOC. The functional connectivity mediated the correlation between structural connectivity and external LOC. In addition, aging-associated neurodegeneration moderated the relationship between structural connectivity and external LOC, showing that the structural connectivity was positively correlated with external LOC in low, but not high neurodegeneration. Our results suggest a critical role of the functional amygdala-frontal network, which may serve as a bridge between its white matter tract and LOC over cognitive competency in groups at high risk for dementia.","authors":[{"family":"Ren","given":"Ping","affiliation":"University of Rochester Medical Center","authorSlug":"ping-ren-OAyjd8","authorName":"Ping Ren","authorID":"25900534","authorSequenceNumber":1,"affiliationSlug":"university-of-rochester-medical-center-DxVe","affiliationID":"4419"},{"family":"Chapman","given":"Benjamin P.","affiliation":"University of Rochester Medical Center","authorSlug":"benjamin-p-chapman-09bZky","authorName":"Benjamin P.

Global and domain-specific (language, executive function, episodic memory, simple attention) cognitive functioning was assessed at in-person interviews. Cross-sectional associations between dLOC and cognition were estimated using covariate-adjusted linear regression models in pooled and sexstratified models.\nResults:In pooled analyses, a one-point increase in dLOC (more internal) was positively associated with global cognition (β=0.05, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.07), language (β=0.04, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.07), and executive function (β=0.04, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.07), but not episodic memory or simple attention. However, in sex-stratified analyses, this effect was seen only in males and not females.\nConclusions:In elderly individuals with T1DM, we found associations between dLOC and cognition overall and in men but not women. Underlying sex differences should be considered in future research or interventions on psychosocial characteristics for cognition.","authors":[{"family":"Eng","given":"Chloe W.","affiliation":"Kaiser Permanente","authorSlug":"chloe-w-eng-mOjXzyY","authorName":"Chloe W.

A comprehensive psychological assessment (personality, anxiety and depression, quality of life, coping strategies, resilience and health-related beliefs) was administered at baseline, at 6 months and 12 months follow-up.Results: Twenty-four participants from 13 families were included. Sixteen participants underwent blood sampling and genetic analysis; 6 resulted to be carriers of pathogenic variants (1 in PSEN1, 1 in PSEN2, 4 in GRN). Carriers showed higher score on the Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA)social competence, and on Multidimensional Health Locus of Controlinternal, than noncarriers (P = 0.03 for both). Ten atrisk relatives who completed the follow-up showed improvement in RSAplanned future (P = 0.01) with respect to baseline. Discussion: Our case series showed that at-risk individuals undergoing predictive testing showed benefit on personal life and no detrimental impact on a broad range of psychological outcomes. Higher social skills and lower internal health locus of control in carriers may be an early psychological correlate of preclinical dementia.","authors":[{"family":"Galluzzi","given":"Samantha","authorSlug":"samantha-galluzzi-g23rlQ1","authorName":"Samantha Galluzzi","authorID":"943113514","authorSequenceNumber":1},{"family":"Mega","given":"Anna","authorSlug":"anna-mega-enyPGdz","authorName":"Anna Mega","authorID":"948459311","authorSequenceNumber":2},{"family":"Mega","given":"Anna","authorSlug":"anna-mega-8mb3WbG","authorName":"Anna Mega","authorID":"944285365","authorSequenceNumber":2},{"family":"Mega","given":"Anna","authorSlug":"anna-mega-LzmDr6a","authorName":"Anna Mega","authorID":"959745484","authorSequenceNumber":2},{"family":"Fede","given":"Giuseppe Di","authorSlug":"giuseppe-di-fede-WEOnP8J","authorName":"Giuseppe Di Fede","authorID":"959925004","authorSequenceNumber":3},{"family":"Fede","given":"Giuseppe Di","authorSlug":"giuseppe-di-fede-2bvwDzJ","authorName":"Giuseppe Di Fede","authorID":"942996132","authorSequenceNumber":3},{"family":"Fede","given":"Giuseppe Di","authorSlug":"giuseppe-di-fede-V8Ykz3M","authorName":"Giuseppe Di Fede","authorID":"946020582","authorSequenceNumber":3},{"family":"Muscio","given":"Cristina","authorSlug":"cristina-muscio-JlNArDY","authorName":"Cristina Muscio","authorID":"946105767","authorSequenceNumber":4},{"family":"Muscio","given":"Cristina","authorSlug":"cristina-muscio-AOkrx8e","authorName":"Cristina Muscio","authorID":"942996149","authorSequenceNumber":4},{"family":"Muscio","given":"Cristina","authorSlug":"cristina-muscio-WEOEdln","authorName":"Cristina Muscio","authorID":"959962348","authorSequenceNumber":4},{"family":"Fascendini","given":"Sara","authorSlug":"sara-fascendini-N8z21AQ","authorName":"Sara Fascendini","authorID":"941648071","authorSequenceNumber":5},{"family":"Fascendini","given":"Sara","authorSlug":"sara-fascendini-Y869ryE","authorName":"Sara Fascendini","authorID":"946105807","authorSequenceNumber":5},{"family":"Fascendini","given":"Sara","authorSlug":"sara-fascendini-4xKLvVP","authorName":"Sara Fascendini","authorID":"959614586","authorSequenceNumber":5},{"family":"Benussi","given":"Luisa","authorSlug":"luisa-benussi-Qkwy0A9","authorName":"Luisa Benussi","authorID":"959718660","authorSequenceNumber":6},{"family":"Benussi","given":"Luisa","authorSlug":"luisa-benussi-vZW9kdJ","authorName":"Luisa Benussi","authorID":"948824097","authorSequenceNumber":6},{"family":"Benussi","given":"Luisa","authorSlug":"luisa-benussi-Qkvjz58","authorName":"Luisa Benussi","authorID":"942074916","authorSequenceNumber":6},{"family":"Tagliavini","given":"Fabrizio","authorSlug":"fabrizio-tagliavini-DRbxEeP","authorName":"Fabrizio Tagliavini","authorID":"959718663","authorSequenceNumber":7},{"family":"Tagliavini","given":"Fabrizio","authorSlug":"fabrizio-tagliavini-Mzpx8aE","authorName":"Fabrizio Tagliavini","authorID":"948177452","authorSequenceNumber":7},{"family":"Tagliavini","given":"Fabrizio","authorSlug":"fabrizio-tagliavini-KgwVRO8","authorName":"Fabrizio Tagliavini","authorID":"945273779","authorSequenceNumber":7},{"family":"Frisoni","given":"Giovanni B.","authorSlug":"giovanni-b-frisoni-kYW3DKa","authorName":"Giovanni B.

We investigated how rapidly response patterns to electrical stimulation can vary in intact human brain. We also investigated whether the type of functional change occurring at a given location with stimulation would help predict the distribution of responses elsewhere over the cortex to stimulation at that given location. We did this by studying cortical afterdischarges following electrical stimulation of the cortex in awake humans undergoing evaluations for brain surgery. Response occurrence and location could change within seconds, both nearby to and distant from stimulation sites. Responses might occur at a given location during one trial but not the next. They could occur at electrodes adjacent or not adjacent to those directly stimulated or to other electrodes showing afterdischarges. The likelihood of an afterdischarge at an individual site after stimulation was predicted by spontaneous electroencephalographic activity at that specific site just prior to stimulation, but not by overall cortical activity. When stimulation at a site interrupted motor, sensory or language function, afterdischarges were more likely to occur at other sites where stimulation interrupted similar functions. These results show that widespread dynamic changes in cortical responses can occur in intact cortex within short periods of time, and that the distribution of these responses depends on local brain states and functional brain architecture at the time of stimulation. Similar rapid variations may occur during normal intracortical communication and may underlie changes in the cortical organization of function. Possibly these variations, and the occurrence and distribution of responses to cortical stimulation, could be predicted. If so, interventions such as stimulation might be used to alter spread of epileptogenic activity, accelerate learning or enhance cortical reorganization after brain injury.","authors":[{"family":"Lesser","given":"Ronald P.","affiliation":"Johns Hopkins University","authorSlug":"ronald-p-lesser-KlYdal","authorName":"Ronald P.

Broad therapeutic application of this technology, however, will require thorough preclinical assessment of off-target editing by homology-based prediction coupled with reliable methods for detecting off-target editing. Several off-target site nomination assays exist, but careful comparison is needed to ascertain their relative strengths and weaknesses. In this study, HEK293T cells were treated with\n     \n      Streptococcus pyogenes\n     \n     Cas9 and eight guide RNAs with varying levels of predicted promiscuity in order to compare the performance of three homology-independent off-target nomination methods: the cell-based assay, GUIDE-seq, and the biochemical assays CIRCLE-seq and SITE-seq. The three methods were benchmarked by sequencing 75,000 homology-nominated sites using hybrid capture followed by high-throughput sequencing, providing the most comprehensive assessment of such methods to date. The three methods performed similarly in nominating sequence-confirmed off-target sites, but with large differences in the total number of sites nominated. When combined with homology-dependent nomination methods and confirmation by sequencing, all three off-target nomination methods provide a comprehensive assessment of off-target activity. GUIDE-seq's low false-positive rate and the high correlation of its signal with observed editing highlight its suitability for nominating off-target sites for\n     \n      ex vivo\n     \n     <strong class=\"highlight\">CRISPR</strong>-Cas therapies.","year":2020,"date":"2020-12-01","lastUpdate":1621320453,"volume":"3","issue":"6","page":"440-453","tally":{"total":9,"supporting":0,"contradicting":0,"mentioning":9,"unclassified":0,"citingPublications":13},"issns":["2573-1599","2573-1602"],"editorialNotices":[{"status":"Comment","date":"2020-12-1","noticeDoi":"10.1089/crispr.2020.29116.smi","doi":"10.1089/crispr.2020.0053"},{"status":"Has erratum","date":"2021-2-1","noticeDoi":"10.1089/crispr.2020.0053.correx","doi":"10.1089/crispr.2020.0053"}],"normalizedTypes":["research support, non-u.s. gov't","article"],"meshTypes":[{"descriptorId":"D000072669","descriptorName":"Gene Editing","qualifierId":"Q000379","qualifierName":"methods"},{"descriptorId":"D000072669","descriptorName":"Gene Editing","qualifierId":"Q000639","qualifierName":"trends"},{"descriptorId":"D000072669","descriptorName":"Gene Editing","qualifierId":"Q000941","qualifierName":"ethics"},{"descriptorId":"D064113","descriptorName":"CRISPR-Cas Systems","qualifierId":"Q000235","qualifierName":"genetics"},{"descriptorId":"D015894","descriptorName":"Genome, Human","qualifierId":"Q000235","qualifierName":"genetics"},{"descriptorId":"D042822","descriptorName":"Genomic Instability","qualifierId":"Q000235","qualifierName":"genetics"},{"descriptorId":"D059014","descriptorName":"High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing","qualifierId":"Q000379","qualifierName":"methods"},{"descriptorId":"D017394","descriptorName":"RNA, Guide","qualifierId":"Q000235","qualifierName":"genetics"},{"descriptorId":"D013297","descriptorName":"Streptococcus pyogenes","qualifierId":"Q000235","qualifierName":"genetics"},{"descriptorId":"D013297","descriptorName":"Streptococcus pyogenes","qualifierId":"Q000472","qualifierName":"pathogenicity"}],"citations":[{"id":2369710504,"source":"10.1089/crispr.2020.0053","target":"10.1038/mtna.2011.5","negative":0.015631215646862984,"positive":0.018351007252931595,"neutral":1.0,"section":"introduction","snippet":"The development of engineered nucleases that target specific sites in the genome has driven advances in basic and applied research at a rapid pace. <cite data-doi=\"10.1126/science.1225829\"> 1 </cite> , <cite data-doi=\"10.1038/mtna.2011.5\"> 2 </cite> The more recent advent of facile <strong class=\"highlight\">CRISPR</strong>-Cas methods for programmable RNA-guided genome editing has further quickened the pace of both discovery and clinical application. <cite data-doi=\"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-pharmtox-010814-124454\"> 3 </cite> , <cite data-doi=\"10.1016/j.omtm.2019.02.008\"> 4 </cite> The Cas9 nuclease, in combination with a chimeric guide RNA (gRNA), cleaves genomic sites in a sequence-specific manner.","lang":"en","langConfidence":"0.8899999856948853","type":"mentioning","typeConfidence":1.0,"refLocation":"b2/1","selfCites":[],"snippetHidden":false}],"highlightedFields":["journal","shortJournal","abstract","citations.snippet","title"]},{"id":"10.1089/crispr.2018.0052","doi":"10.1089/crispr.2018.0052","title":"Meet the Anti-<strong class=\"highlight\">CRISPRs</strong>: Widespread Protein Inhibitors of <strong class=\"highlight\">CRISPR</strong>-Cas Systems","slug":"meet-the-anti-crisprs-widespread-protein-A32PLdE","authors":[{"authorName":"Sungwon Hwang","authorSlug":"sungwon-hwang-G35YWgb","authorSequenceNumber":"1","affiliation":"University of Toronto","affiliationSlug":"university-of-toronto-xWjA"},{"authorName":"Karen L.

We utilized two different Cas types (Cpf1 and Cas9n) to induce two distinct incisions at the respective ends of the lssDNA cassette junctions on the plasmid, yielding three independent single-stranded DNA units of unique sizes eligible for strand separation, followed by target strand clip-out through gel extraction. The retrieval of the lssDNA donor circumvents involvements of restriction enzymes and DNA polymerase-based steps. Hence, it not only retains sequence fidelity but also carries virtually no restriction on sequence composition, further mitigating limitations on the current Easi-<strong class=\"highlight\">CRISPR</strong> method. With the add-on feature of universal DNA-tag sequences of Cpf1-Cas9 duo protospacer adjacent motif, <strong class=\"highlight\">CRISPR</strong>-CLIP can be facile and applicable to generate lssDNA templates for any genomic target of choice.

support adipocyte maturation and promote glucose tolerance in obesity OPEN","abstract":"Accumulating data have indicated a fundamental role of eosinophils in regulating adipose tissue homeostasis. Here, we performed whole-genome RNA sequencing of the small intestinal tract, which suggested the presence of impaired lipid metabolism in eosinophil-deficient ΔdblGATA mice. ΔdblGATA mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) showed reduced body fat mass, impaired enlargement of adipocytes, decreased expression of adipogenic genes, and developed glucose intolerance. HFD induced accumulation of eosinophils in the perigonadal white adipose tissue. Concordantly, adipocytedifferentiated 3T3-L1 cells promoted the migration of eosinophils through the expression of CCL11 (eotaxin-1) and likely promoted their survival through the expression of interleukin (IL)-3, IL-5, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. HFD-fed ΔdblGATA mice showed increased infiltration of macrophages, CD4 + T-cells, and B-cells, increased expression of interferon-γ, and decreased expression of IL-4 and IL-13 in white adipose tissue. Interferon-γ treatment significantly decreased lipid deposition in adipocyte-differentiated 3T3-L1 cells, while IL-4 treatment promoted lipid accumulation. Notably, HFD-fed ΔdblGATA mice showed increased lipid storage in the liver as compared with wild-type mice. We propose that obesity promotes the infiltration of eosinophils into adipose tissue that subsequently contribute to the metabolic homeostasis by promoting adipocyte maturation.Eosinophils have been considered as destructive cells involved in T helper cell type (Th) 2 immune responses in parasitic infections or allergic diseases 1 . However, accumulating evidence has indicated additional roles for eosinophils. For example, eosinophils reside in several organs including the gastrointestinal tract 2,3 and adipose tissue and contribute to metabolic homeostasis 4,5 . Adipose tissue eosinophils secrete interleukin (IL)-4 and induce the polarization of white adipose tissue (WAT) macrophages into alternatively-activated macrophages, which support glucose tolerance by regulating local catecholamine stores in the microenvironment through the import of catecholamines produced by nerve cells 4,6,7 . Despite recent advances, the roles of eosinophils in the adipose tissue and their effects on adipocyte function remain incompletely understood.Obesity and its associated metabolic disorders are serious health problems worldwide 8 . However, obesity is not necessarily an adverse metabolic condition when the excess fat is stored in adipose tissue that responds to insulin 9 .

Here, we performed whole-genome RNA sequencing of the small intestinal tract, which suggested the presence of impaired lipid metabolism in eosinophil-deficient ΔdblGATA mice. ΔdblGATA mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) showed reduced body fat mass, impaired enlargement of adipocytes, decreased expression of adipogenic genes, and developed glucose intolerance. HFD induced accumulation of eosinophils in the perigonadal white adipose tissue. Concordantly, adipocyte-differentiated 3T3-L1 cells promoted the migration of eosinophils through the expression of CCL11 (eotaxin-1) and likely promoted their survival through the expression of interleukin (IL)-3, IL-5, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. HFD-fed ΔdblGATA mice showed increased infiltration of macrophages, CD4+ T-cells, and B-cells, increased expression of interferon-γ, and decreased expression of IL-4 and IL-13 in white adipose tissue. Interferon-γ treatment significantly decreased lipid deposition in adipocyte-differentiated 3T3-L1 cells, while IL-4 treatment promoted lipid accumulation. Notably, HFD-fed ΔdblGATA mice showed increased lipid storage in the liver as compared with wild-type mice. We propose that obesity promotes the infiltration of eosinophils into adipose tissue that subsequently contribute to the metabolic homeostasis by promoting adipocyte maturation.","authors":[{"family":"Lee","given":"Eun-Hui","affiliation":"Gachon University","authorSlug":"eun-hui-lee-KQMmMe","authorName":"Eun-Hui Lee","authorID":"152962979","authorSequenceNumber":1,"affiliationSlug":"gachon-university-yJdl","affiliationID":"9120"},{"family":"Itan","given":"Michal","affiliation":"Tel Aviv University","authorSlug":"michal-itan-aXkmEv","authorName":"Michal Itan","authorID":"5216739","authorSequenceNumber":2,"affiliationSlug":"tel-aviv-university-KPbp","affiliationID":"12679"},{"family":"Jang","given":"Jinsun","affiliation":"Gachon University","authorSlug":"jinsun-jang-2Zd5bY","authorName":"Jinsun Jang","authorID":"152979076","authorSequenceNumber":3,"affiliationSlug":"gachon-university-yJdl","affiliationID":"9120"},{"family":"Gu","given":"Hyeon-Jung","affiliation":"Gachon University","authorSlug":"hyeon-jung-gu-5O8x8G","authorName":"Hyeon-Jung Gu","authorID":"152933925","authorSequenceNumber":4,"affiliationSlug":"gachon-university-yJdl","affiliationID":"9120"},{"family":"Rozenberg","given":"Perri","affiliation":"Tel Aviv University","authorSlug":"perri-rozenberg-rx4Y46","authorName":"Perri Rozenberg","authorID":"11006029","authorSequenceNumber":5,"affiliationSlug":"tel-aviv-university-KPbp","affiliationID":"12679"},{"family":"Mingler","given":"Melissa K.","affiliation":"Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center","authorSlug":"melissa-k-mingler-kenLwL","authorName":"Melissa K.

The discovery that obesity itself results in an inflammatory state in metabolic tissues ushered in a research field that examines the inflammatory mechanisms in obesity. Here, we summarize the unique features of this metabolic inflammatory state, termed metaflammation and defined as low-grade, chronic inflammation orchestrated by metabolic cells in response to excess nutrients and energy. We explore the effects of such inflammation in metabolic tissues including adipose, liver, muscle, pancreas, and brain and its contribution to insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction. Another area in which many unknowns still exist is the origin or mechanism of initiation of inflammatory signaling in obesity. We discuss signals or triggers to the inflammatory response, including the possibility of endoplasmic reticulum stress as an important contributor to metaflammation. Finally, we examine anti-inflammatory therapies for their potential in the treatment of obesity-related insulin resistance and glucose intolerance.","authors":[{"family":"Gregor","given":"Margaret F.","affiliation":"Harvard University","authorSlug":"margaret-f-gregor-Q6O5K9","authorName":"Margaret F.

The 12/15‐lipoxygenase (12/15‐LO) enzyme has been linked to inflammatory changes in blood vessels that precede the development of atherosclerosis. The expression and role of 12/15‐LO in adipocytes have not been evaluated. We found that 12/15‐LO mRNA was dramatically upregulated in white epididymal adipocytes of high‐fat fed mice. 12/15‐LO was poorly expressed in 3T3‐L1 fibroblasts and was upregulated during differentiation into adipocytes. Interestingly, the saturated fatty acid palmitate, a major component of high fat diets, augmented expression of 12/15‐LO in vitro. When 3T3‐L1 adipocytes were treated with the 12/15‐LO products, 12‐hydroxyeicosatetranoic acid (12(S)‐HETE) and 12‐hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12(S)‐HPETE), expression of proinflammatory cytokine genes, including tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP‐1), interleukin 6 (IL‐6), and IL‐12p40, was upregulated whereas anti‐inflammatory adiponectin gene expression was downregulated. 12/15‐LO products also augmented c‐Jun N‐terminal kinase 1 (JNK‐1) phosphorylation, a known negative regulator of insulin signaling. Consistent with impaired insulin signaling, we found that insulin‐stimulated 3T3‐L1 adipocytes exhibited decreased IRS‐1(Tyr) phosphorylation, increased IRS‐1(Ser) phosphorylation, and impaired Akt phosphorylation when treated with 12/15‐LO product. Taken together, our data suggest that 12/15‐LO products create a proinflammatory state and impair insulin signaling in 3T3‐L1 adipocytes. Because 12/15‐LO expression is upregulated in visceral adipocytes by high‐fat feeding in vivo and also by addition of palmitic acid in vitro, we propose that 12/15‐LO plays a role in promoting inflammation and insulin resistance associated with obesity.","authors":[{"family":"Chakrabarti","given":"Swarup K.","affiliation":"Eastern Virginia Medical School","authorSlug":"swarup-k-chakrabarti-kEaKjX","authorName":"Swarup K.

The underlying reasons are complex but likely related to ectopic lipid deposition in nonadipose tissue. We hypothesized that the inability to appropriately expand subcutaneous adipose tissue may be an underlying reason for insulin resistance and beta cell failure. Mice lacking leptin while overexpressing adiponectin showed normalized glucose and insulin levels and dramatically improved glucose as well as positively affected serum triglyceride levels. Therefore, modestly increasing the levels of circulating full-length adiponectin completely rescued the diabetic phenotype in ob/ob mice. They displayed increased expression of PPARgamma target genes and a reduction in macrophage infiltration in adipose tissue and systemic inflammation. As a result, the transgenic mice were morbidly obese, with significantly higher levels of adipose tissue than their ob/ob littermates, leading to an interesting dichotomy of increased fat mass associated with improvement in insulin sensitivity. Based on these data, we propose that adiponectin acts as a peripheral \"starvation\" signal promoting the storage of triglycerides preferentially in adipose tissue. As a consequence, reduced triglyceride levels in the liver and muscle convey improved systemic insulin sensitivity. These mice therefore represent what we believe is a novel model of morbid obesity associated with an improved metabolic profile.","authors":[{"family":"Kim","given":"Ja Young","affiliation":"Yeshiva University","authorSlug":"ja-young-kim-EAkxZK","authorName":"Ja Young Kim","authorID":"56710517","authorSequenceNumber":1,"affiliationSlug":"yeshiva-university-5QJW","affiliationID":"25469"},{"family":"Wall","given":"Esther Van De","affiliation":"Yeshiva University","authorSlug":"esther-van-de-wall-je4JVl","authorName":"Esther Van De Wall","authorID":"74763281","authorSequenceNumber":2,"affiliationSlug":"yeshiva-university-5QJW","affiliationID":"25469"},{"family":"Laplante","given":"Mathieu","affiliation":"Université Laval","authorSlug":"mathieu-laplante-E0XDXk","authorName":"Mathieu Laplante","authorID":"73675717","authorSequenceNumber":3,"affiliationSlug":"universite-laval-WxWg","affiliationID":"7104"},{"family":"Azzara","given":"Anthony","affiliation":"Yeshiva University","authorSlug":"anthony-azzara-1daWXj","authorName":"Anthony Azzara","authorID":"66287203","authorSequenceNumber":4,"affiliationSlug":"yeshiva-university-5QJW","affiliationID":"25469"},{"family":"Trujillo","given":"Maria E.","affiliation":"Yeshiva University","authorSlug":"maria-e-trujillo-Nnvzpm","authorName":"Maria E.

Herein, we demonstrate that cross-talk between the Ig-superfamily receptor CD300f and IL-5 is a key checkpoint that modifies the ability of eosinophils to regulate metabolic outcomes. Generation of Il5\nTg\n/Cd300f\n−/− mice revealed marked and distinct increases in eosinophil levels and their production of IL-4 in the white and brown adipose tissues. Consequently, Il5\nTg\n/Cd300f\n−/− mice had increased alternatively activated macrophage accumulation in the adipose tissue. Cd300f\n−/− mice displayed age-related accumulation of eosinophils and macrophages in the adipose tissue and decreased adipose tissue weight, which was associated with decreased diet-induced weight gain and insulin resistance. Notably, Il5\nTg\n/CD300f\n−/− were protected from diet-induced weight gain and glucose intolerance.

However, little is known about other immune cells in adipose tissue from obese people, and whether they contribute to insulin resistance. We investigated the characteristics of T cells in adipose tissue from metabolically abnormal insulin-resistant obese (MAO) subjects, metabolically normal insulin-sensitive obese (MNO) subjects, and lean subjects. Insulin sensitivity was determined by using the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp procedure.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe assessed plasma cytokine concentrations and subcutaneous adipose tissue CD4+ T-cell populations in 9 lean, 12 MNO, and 13 MAO subjects. Skeletal muscle and liver samples were collected from 19 additional obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery to determine the presence of selected cytokine receptors.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAdipose tissue from MAO subjects had 3- to 10-fold increases in numbers of CD4+ T cells that produce interleukin (IL)-22 and IL-17 (a T-helper [Th] 17 and Th22 phenotype) compared with MNO and lean subjects. MAO subjects also had increased plasma concentrations of IL-22 and IL-6. Receptors for IL-17 and IL-22 were expressed in human liver and skeletal muscle samples. IL-17 and IL-22 inhibited uptake of glucose in skeletal muscle isolated from rats and reduced insulin sensitivity in cultured human hepatocytes.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAdipose tissue from MAO individuals contains increased numbers of Th17 and Th22 cells, which produce cytokines that cause metabolic dysfunction in liver and muscle in vitro. Additional studies are needed to determine whether these alterations in adipose tissue T cells contribute to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in obese people.","authors":[{"family":"Fabbrini","given":"Elisa","affiliation":"Washington University in St. Louis","authorSlug":"elisa-fabbrini-dvbLj1","authorName":"Elisa Fabbrini","authorID":"6328562","authorSequenceNumber":1,"affiliationSlug":"washington-university-in-st-louis-jjaJ","affiliationID":"19037"},{"family":"Cella","given":"Marina","affiliation":"Washington University in St. Louis","authorSlug":"marina-cella-G6AaLL","authorName":"Marina Cella","authorID":"19860613","authorSequenceNumber":2,"affiliationSlug":"washington-university-in-st-louis-jjaJ","affiliationID":"19037"},{"family":"Mccartney","given":"Steve A.","affiliation":"Washington University in St. Louis","authorSlug":"steve-a-mccartney-pVLNLw","authorName":"Steve A.

visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is a hallmark of obesity associated insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Here we demonstrate a fundamental pathogenic role for B cells in the development of these metabolic abnormalities. B cells accumulate in VAT in diet induced obese (DIO) mice, and DIO mice lacking B cells are protected from disease despite weight gain. B cell effects on glucose metabolism are mechanistically linked to activation of pro-inflammatory macrophages and T cells, and production of pathogenic IgG antibodies. Treatment with a B cell-depleting CD20 antibody attenuates disease, while transfer of DIO-IgG rapidly induces insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Moreover, insulin resistance in obese humans is associated with a unique profile of IgG autoantibodies. These results establish the importance of B cells and adaptive immunity in insulin resistance and suggest new diagnostic and therapeutic modalities to manage the disease.","authors":[{"family":"Winer","given":"Daniel A.","affiliation":"Stanford University","authorSlug":"daniel-a-winer-PQxdEVR","authorName":"Daniel A.

We hypothesized that neutrophil infiltration into adipose tissue may precede macrophage infiltration as in classical immune responses. Here we demonstrate that early (3 and 7 days) after initiating high-fat feeding of C57BL/6J mice, neutrophils transiently infiltrate the parenchyma of intra-abdominal adipose tissue. Mean periepdidymal fat myeloperoxidase expression (representing neutrophils) was significantly increased 3.5-fold (P , 0.01) and 2.9-fold (P , 0.03), at days 3 and 7 compared with day 0. Immunohystochemistry analysis demonstrated a physical binding between neutrophils and adipocytes, which was supported by in vitro adherence assay: mouse peritoneal neutrophils adhered to a monolayer of 3T3-L1 mouse adipocytes, in a manner dependent on their activation state, 41.9 6 3.7% or 29.5 6 2%, by PMA or the IL-8 analog CXCL1 (KC), respectively, compared with 24.8 6 1.5% in unstimulated neutrophils, respectively. The degree of surface exposure of CD11b (Mac-1) corresponded to the percentage of adhered neutrophils. The adherence was prevented by preincubating neutrophils or adipocytes with anti-CD11b or anti-ICAM-1 antibodies. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation of CD11b from lysates of a mixed neutrophil-adipocyte cell population resulted in coimmunoprecipitation of ICAM-1, indicating that the interaction is mediated by neutrophil CD11b and adipocyte ICAM-1.-Elgazar-Carmon, V., A.

Balanced cytodifferentiation of stem cells is essential for the formation and maintenance of bone marrow; however, the mechanisms that control this balance remain largely unknown. Whereas cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumour-necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibit adipogenesis, the ligand-induced transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma), is a key inducer of adipogenesis. Therefore, regulatory coupling between cytokine- and PPAR-gamma-mediated signals might occur during adipogenesis. Here we show that the ligand-induced transactivation function of PPAR-gamma is suppressed by IL-1 and TNF-alpha, and that this suppression is mediated through NF-kappaB activated by the TAK1/TAB1/NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) cascade, a downstream cascade associated with IL-1 and TNF-alpha signalling. Unlike suppression of the PPAR-gamma transactivation function by mitogen-activated protein kinase-induced growth factor signalling through phosphorylation of the A/B domain, NF-kappaB blocks PPAR-gamma binding to DNA by forming a complex with PPAR-gamma and its AF-1-specific co-activator PGC-2. Our results suggest that expression of IL-1 and TNF-alpha in bone marrow may alter the fate of pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells, directing cellular differentiation towards osteoblasts rather than adipocytes by suppressing PPAR-gamma function through NF-kappaB activated by the TAK1/TAB1/NIK cascade.","authors":[{"family":"Suzawa","given":"Miyuki","affiliation":"University of Tokyo","authorSlug":"miyuki-suzawa-2WX942D","authorName":"Miyuki Suzawa","authorID":"385146832","authorSequenceNumber":1,"affiliationSlug":"university-of-tokyo-QYyz","affiliationID":"11716"},{"family":"Takada","given":"Ichiro","affiliation":"University of Tokyo","authorSlug":"ichiro-takada-rxwyEA","authorName":"Ichiro Takada","authorID":"10649873","authorSequenceNumber":2,"affiliationSlug":"university-of-tokyo-QYyz","affiliationID":"11716"},{"family":"Yanagisawa","given":"Junn","affiliation":"University of Tokyo","authorSlug":"junn-yanagisawa-lxgANM","authorName":"Junn Yanagisawa","authorID":"140018780","authorSequenceNumber":3,"affiliationSlug":"university-of-tokyo-QYyz","affiliationID":"11716"},{"family":"Ohtake","given":"Fumiaki","affiliation":"University of Tokyo","authorSlug":"fumiaki-ohtake-EWvNmW","authorName":"Fumiaki Ohtake","authorID":"7433361","authorSequenceNumber":4,"affiliationSlug":"university-of-tokyo-QYyz","affiliationID":"11716"},{"family":"Ogawa","given":"Satoko","affiliation":"National Institute for Basic Biology","authorSlug":"satoko-ogawa-xxjk4g","authorName":"Satoko Ogawa","authorID":"28753366","authorSequenceNumber":5,"affiliationSlug":"national-institute-for-basic-biology-4ZMN","affiliationID":"7342"},{"family":"Yamauchi","given":"Toshimasa","affiliation":"University of Tokyo","authorSlug":"toshimasa-yamauchi-ng0ZPN","authorName":"Toshimasa Yamauchi","authorID":"8070377","authorSequenceNumber":6,"affiliationSlug":"university-of-tokyo-QYyz","affiliationID":"11716"},{"family":"Yamauchi","given":"Toshimasa","affiliation":"University of Tokyo","authorSlug":"toshimasa-yamauchi-y8waOn6","authorName":"Toshimasa Yamauchi","authorID":"205520820","authorSequenceNumber":6,"affiliationSlug":"university-of-tokyo-QYyz","affiliationID":"11716"},{"family":"Kadowaki","given":"Takashi","affiliation":"University of Tokyo","authorSlug":"takashi-kadowaki-W8Lmzyg","authorName":"Takashi Kadowaki","authorID":"261239592","authorSequenceNumber":7,"affiliationSlug":"university-of-tokyo-QYyz","affiliationID":"11716"},{"family":"Takeuchi","given":"Yasuhiro","affiliation":"University of Tokyo","authorSlug":"yasuhiro-takeuchi-klWy5y","authorName":"Yasuhiro Takeuchi","authorID":"81359524","authorSequenceNumber":8,"affiliationSlug":"university-of-tokyo-QYyz","affiliationID":"11716"},{"family":"Shibuya","given":"Hiroshi","affiliation":"National Institute for Basic Biology","authorSlug":"hiroshi-shibuya-1Qj4Jy","authorName":"Hiroshi Shibuya","authorID":"76280891","authorSequenceNumber":9,"affiliationSlug":"national-institute-for-basic-biology-4ZMN","affiliationID":"7342"},{"family":"Gotoh","given":"Yukiko","affiliation":"University of Tokyo","authorSlug":"yukiko-gotoh-ADKWQe","authorName":"Yukiko Gotoh","authorID":"27430905","authorSequenceNumber":10,"affiliationSlug":"university-of-tokyo-QYyz","affiliationID":"11716"},{"family":"Matsumoto","given":"Kunihiro","affiliation":"Nagoya University","authorSlug":"kunihiro-matsumoto-DR9k0e","authorName":"Kunihiro Matsumoto","authorID":"19915519","authorSequenceNumber":11,"affiliationSlug":"nagoya-university-rLD3","affiliationID":"8173"},{"family":"Kato","given":"Shigeaki","affiliation":"University of Tokyo","authorSlug":"shigeaki-kato-25kG4L","authorName":"Shigeaki Kato","authorID":"144333332","authorSequenceNumber":12,"affiliationSlug":"university-of-tokyo-QYyz","affiliationID":"11716"}],"year":2003,"shortJournal":"Nat Cell Biol","publisher":"Springer Science and Business Media LLC","issue":"3","volume":"5","page":"224-230","retracted":false,"memberId":297,"issns":["1465-7392","1476-4679"],"editorialNotices":[{"status":"Has correction","date":"2014-10-31","noticeDoi":"10.1038/ncb3068","doi":"10.1038/ncb942"},{"status":"Retracted","date":"2014-10-31","noticeDoi":"10.1038/ncb3068","doi":"10.1038/ncb942"}],"journalSlug":"r6W4d","journal":"Nature Cell Biology","preprintLinks":[],"publicationLinks":[],"normalizedTypes":["article"]},"10.1007/s11892-008-0032-z":{"id":61188900,"doi":"10.1007/s11892-008-0032-z","slug":"ectopic-fat-and-insulin-resistance-3g5eOO","type":"journal-article","title":"Ectopic fat and insulin resistance","abstract":"Ectopic fat is defined by the deposition of triglycerides within cells of non-adipose tissue that normally contain only small amounts of fat. Over the past decade, magnetic resonance spectroscopy has been used extensively for noninvasive quantification of intramyocellular, intrahepatocellular, and more recently myocardial and pancreatic lipids. In liver and muscle, triglyceride content usually correlates with whole-body and tissue-specific insulin sensitivity. However, fat mass and oxidative capacity influence this relationship, indicating that ectopic lipid content is not the only factor that explains insulin resistance. Ectopic lipids may rather serve as biomarkers of the balance between metabolic supply and demand in different states of insulin sensitivity. Consequently, ectopic lipid concentrations, particularly in the liver, decrease with lifestyle- or drug-induced improvement of insulin sensitivity.","authors":[{"family":"Lettner","given":"Angelika","affiliation":"Hanusch Hospital","authorSlug":"angelika-lettner-X4eL6k","authorName":"Angelika Lettner","authorID":"11468441","authorSequenceNumber":1,"affiliationSlug":"hanusch-hospital-NM0w9","affiliationID":"197271"},{"family":"Roden","given":"Michael","affiliation":"Hanusch Hospital","authorSlug":"michael-roden-Ezr13L","authorName":"Michael Roden","authorID":"144668417","authorSequenceNumber":2,"affiliationSlug":"hanusch-hospital-NM0w9","affiliationID":"197271"}],"year":2008,"shortJournal":"Curr Diab Rep","publisher":"Springer Science and Business Media LLC","issue":"3","volume":"8","page":"185-191","retracted":false,"memberId":297,"issns":["1534-4827","1539-0829"],"editorialNotices":[],"journalSlug":"jMJGJ","journal":"Current Diabetes Reports","preprintLinks":[],"publicationLinks":[],"normalizedTypes":["article"]},"10.1146/annurev.med.53.082901.104057":{"id":105740370,"doi":"10.1146/annurev.med.53.082901.104057","slug":"lipotoxic-diseases-RX8EN3","type":"journal-article","title":"Lipotoxic Diseases","abstract":"I review evidence that leptin is a liporegulatory hormone that controls lipid homeostasis in nonadipose tissues during periods of overnutrition. When adipocytes store excess calories as triacylglycerol (TG), leptin secretion rises so as to prevent accumulation of lipids in nonadipose tissues, which are not adapted for TG storage. Whenever leptin action is lacking, whether through leptin deficiency or leptin resistance, overnutrition causes disease of nonadipose tissues with generalized steatosis, lipotoxicity, and lipoapoptosis. Examples of such disorders of liporegulation include generalized lipodystrophies, mutations of leptin and leptin receptor genes, and diet-induced obesity. Lipotoxicity of pancreatic beta-cells, myocardium, and skeletal muscle leads, respectively, to type 2 diabetes, cardiomyopathy, and insulin resistance. In humans this constellation of abnormalities is referred to as the metabolic syndrome, a major health problem in the United States. When lipids overaccumulate in nonadipose tissues during overnutrition, fatty acids enter deleterious pathways such as ceramide production, which, through increased nitric oxide formation, causes apoptosis of lipid-laden cells, such as beta-cells and cardiomyocytes. Lipoapoptosis can be prevented by caloric restriction, by thiazolidinedione treatment, and by administration of nitric oxide blockers. There is now substantial evidence that complications of human obesity may reflect lipotoxicity similar to that described in rodents.","authors":[{"family":"Unger","given":"Roger H.","affiliation":"The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center","authorSlug":"roger-h-unger-xPJRMOw","authorName":"Roger H.

In this study, by examining mice with a selective deficiency of systemic eosinophils (by lineage ablation) or GI eosinophils (eotaxin-1/2 double–deficient or CC chemokine receptor 3–deficient), we show that eosinophils support immunoglobulin A (IgA) class switching, maintain intestinal mucus secretions, affect intestinal microbial composition, and promote the development of Peyer’s patches. Eosinophil-deficient mice showed reduced expression of mediators of secretory IgA production, including intestinal interleukin 1β (IL-1β), inducible nitric oxide synthase, lymphotoxin (LT) α, and LT-β, and reduced levels of retinoic acid-related orphan receptor gamma t–positive (ROR-γt+) innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) while maintaining normal levels of APRIL (a proliferation-inducing ligand), BAFF (B cell–activating factor of the tumor necrosis factor family), and TGF-β (transforming growth factor β). GI eosinophils expressed a relatively high level of IL-1β, and IL-1β–deficient mice manifested the altered gene expression profiles observed in eosinophil-deficient mice and decreased levels of IgA+ cells and ROR-γt+ ILCs. On the basis of these collective data, we propose that eosinophils are required for homeostatic intestinal immune responses including IgA production and that their affect is mediated via IL-1β in the small intestine.","authors":[{"family":"Jung","given":"Yun-Jae","affiliation":"Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center","authorSlug":"yun-jae-jung-2PO1JE","authorName":"Yun-Jae Jung","authorID":"139679076","authorSequenceNumber":1,"affiliationSlug":"cincinnati-children-s-hospital-medical-center-pADQ","affiliationID":"16374"},{"family":"Wen","given":"Ting","affiliation":"Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center","authorSlug":"ting-wen-EOXp5P","authorName":"Ting Wen","authorID":"17384861","authorSequenceNumber":2,"affiliationSlug":"cincinnati-children-s-hospital-medical-center-pADQ","affiliationID":"16374"},{"family":"Mingler","given":"M K","affiliation":"University of Cincinnati","authorSlug":"m-k-mingler-38LOGQO","authorName":"M K Mingler","authorID":"411647800","authorSequenceNumber":3,"affiliationSlug":"university-of-cincinnati-bQ3Z","affiliationID":"19659"},{"family":"Caldwell","given":"J M","affiliation":"University of Cincinnati","authorSlug":"j-m-caldwell-vydAJ14","authorName":"J M Caldwell","authorID":"346531809","authorSequenceNumber":4,"affiliationSlug":"university-of-cincinnati-bQ3Z","affiliationID":"19659"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Y H","affiliation":"University of Cincinnati","authorSlug":"y-h-wang-1vR92W","authorName":"Y H Wang","authorID":"48788791","authorSequenceNumber":5,"affiliationSlug":"university-of-cincinnati-bQ3Z","affiliationID":"19659"},{"family":"Chaplin","given":"David D.","affiliation":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","authorSlug":"david-d-chaplin-a66kyx","authorName":"David D.

Obesity and its comorbidities are associated with impaired adipose tissue (AT) function. In the last decade, eosinophils have been identified as regulators of proper AT function. Our study aimed to determine whether normalizing the number of AT eosinophils in obese mice, to those of lean healthy mice, would reduce obesity and/or improve metabolic fitness.MethodsC57BL/6J mice fed a high fat diet (HFD) were simultaneously given recombinant interleukin-5 (rIL5) for 8 weeks to increase AT eosinophils. Metabolic fitness was tested by evaluating weight gain, AT inflammation, glucose, lipid, and mixed-meal tolerance, AT insulin signaling, energy substrate utilization, energy expenditure, and white AT beiging capacity.ResultsEosinophils were increased ∼3-fold in AT of obese HFD-fed mice treated with rIL5, and thus were restored to levels observed in lean healthy mice. However, there were no significant differences in rIL5-treated mice among the above listed comprehensive set of metabolic assays, despite the increased AT eosinophils.ConclusionsWe have shown that restoring obese AT eosinophils to lean healthy levels is not sufficient to allow for improvement in any of a range of metabolic features otherwise impaired in obesity. Thus, the mechanisms that identified eosinophils as positive regulators of AT function, and therefore systemic health, are more complex than initially understood and will require further study to fully elucidate.","authors":[{"family":"Bolus","given":"W.

However, how ILC2 in adipose tissue is regulated remains largely unknown. Here, our present study shows that ILC2s are present in brown adipose tissue (BAT) as well as subcutaneous and epididymal WAT (sWAT and eWAT). The fractions of ILC2s, Natural Killer T (NKT) cells and eosinophils in sWAT, eWAT and BAT are significantly decreased by high fat diet (HFD) feeding and leptin deficiency-induced obesity. Consistent with this, the adipose expression and circulating levels of IL-33, a key inducing cytokine of ILC2 are significantly downregulated by obesity. Furthermore, administration of IL-33 markedly increases the fraction of ILC2 and eosinophil as well as expression of UCP1 and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine biosynthesis, in adipose tissue of HFD-fed mice. On the other hand, cold exposure induces the expression levels of IL-33 and UCP1 and the population of ILC2 and eosinophil in sWAT, and these promoting effects of cold stress are reversed by neutralization of IL-33 signaling in vivo. Moreover, the basal and cold-induced IL-33 and ILC2/eosinophil pathways are significantly suppressed by sympathetic denervation via local injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in sWAT. Taken together, our data suggests that the ILC2/eosinophil axis in adipose tissue is regulated by sympathetic nervous system and obesity in IL-33-dependent manner, and IL-33-driven ILC2/eosinophil axis are implicated in the development of obesity.","authors":[{"family":"Ding","given":"Xiaofeng","affiliation":"Hunan Normal University","authorSlug":"xiaofeng-ding-rQzwdO","authorName":"Xiaofeng Ding","authorID":"20857129","authorSequenceNumber":1,"affiliationSlug":"hunan-normal-university-Jn2G","affiliationID":"14267"},{"family":"Luo","given":"Yan","affiliation":"Central South University","authorSlug":"yan-luo-9k1n5E","authorName":"Yan Luo","authorID":"84945490","authorSequenceNumber":2,"affiliationSlug":"central-south-university-zdvb","affiliationID":"26050"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xing","authorSlug":"xing-zhang-Qlp0a9","authorName":"Xing Zhang","authorID":"103107960","authorSequenceNumber":3},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Handong","authorSlug":"handong-zheng-OdOzp6","authorName":"Handong Zheng","authorID":"61202478","authorSequenceNumber":4},{"family":"Yang","given":"Xin","authorSlug":"xin-yang-r55Xv4","authorName":"Xin Yang","authorID":"149529729","authorSequenceNumber":5},{"family":"Yang","given":"Xuexian O.","authorSlug":"xuexian-o-yang-YDngGP","authorName":"Xuexian O.

A variety of mouse strains have been used for this purpose. However, mouse strains can differ in their inherent propensities to develop metabolic disease, which may affect the experimental outcomes of metabolic studies. We have investigated straindependent differences in the susceptibility to diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance in five commonly used inbred mouse strains (C57BL/6J, 129X1/SvJ, BALB/c, DBA/2 and FVB/N). Methods Mice were fed either a low-fat or a high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks. Whole-body energy expenditure and body composition were then determined. Tissues were used to measure markers of mitochondrial metabolism, inflammation, oxidative stress and lipid accumulation. Results BL6, 129X1, DBA/2 and FVB/N mice were all susceptible to varying degrees to HFD-induced obesity, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, but BALB/c mice exhibited some protection from these detrimental effects. This protection could not be explained by differences in mitochondrial metabolism or oxidative stress in liver or muscle, or inflammation in adipose tissue. Interestingly, in contrast with the other strains, BALB/c mice did not accumulate excess lipid (triacylglycerols and diacylglycerols) in the liver; this is potentially related to lower fatty acid uptake rather than differences in lipogenesis or lipid oxidation. Conclusions/interpretation Collectively, our findings indicate that most mouse strains develop metabolic defects on an HFD. However, there are inherent differences between strains, and thus the genetic background needs to be considered carefully in metabolic studies. \nKeywords","authors":[{"family":"Montgomery","given":"Magdalene K.","affiliation":"Garvan Institute of Medical Research","authorSlug":"magdalene-k-montgomery-6JAODr","authorName":"Magdalene K.

We investigated immunometabolic phenotype of C57Bl/6 and BALB/c mice, prototypical Th1 and Th2-type strains, fed chow or high-fat diet (HFD) for 24 weeks. In comparison to C57Bl/6 mice, chow-fed BALB/c mice had higher body weight and weight gain, lower glycemia, more pronounced liver steatosis, but less inflammation and collagen deposition in liver. In response to HFD C57Bl/6 mice exhibited higher weight gain, higher glycemia, HbA1c and liver glycogen content, increased amount of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and number of VAT associated CD3+CXCR3+ T cells, CD11c+ dendritic cells (DCs) and F4/80+ macrophages than BALB/c mice. More numerous CD3+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, myeloid DCs, proinflammatory macrophages (F4/80+CD11b+CD11+ and F4/80+IL-1β+) and CD11b+Ly6Chigh monocytes and higher levels of proinflammatory IL-6, TNF-α and IFN-γ were present in liver in HFD-fed C57Bl/6 mice compared with diet-matched BALB/c mice. As opposed to C57Bl/6 mice, HFD induced marked liver steatosis and upregulated the hepatic LXRα and PPARγ genes in BALB/c mice. C57Bl/6 mice fed HFD developed liver fibrosis and increased hepatic procollagen and TGF-β mRNA expression, and IL-33, IL-13 and TGF-β levels in liver homogenates, while BALB/c mice fed HFD had scarce collagen deposition in liver. The obtained results suggest inherent immunometabolic differences in C57Bl/6 and BALB/c mice. Moreover, HFD Th1-type mice on high fat diet regimen are more susceptible to adiposity, liver inflammation and fibrosis, while Th2-type mice to liver steatosis, which is associated with differential immune cell composition in metabolic tissues. Strain-dependent differences in immunometabolic phenotype may be relevant for studies of obesity-associated metabolic diseases in humans.","authors":[{"family":"Jovicic","given":"Nemanja","affiliation":"University of Kragujevac","authorSlug":"nemanja-jovicic-Ja34XE","authorName":"Nemanja Jovicic","authorID":"11814723","authorSequenceNumber":1,"affiliationSlug":"university-of-kragujevac-QWPM","affiliationID":"22460"},{"family":"Jeftic","given":"Ilija","affiliation":"University of Kragujevac","authorSlug":"ilija-jeftic-0a6VzP","authorName":"Ilija Jeftic","authorID":"11217656","authorSequenceNumber":2,"affiliationSlug":"university-of-kragujevac-QWPM","affiliationID":"22460"},{"family":"Jovanovic","given":"Ivan","affiliation":"University of Kragujevac","authorSlug":"ivan-jovanovic-wb0zdL","authorName":"Ivan Jovanovic","authorID":"8132872","authorSequenceNumber":3,"affiliationSlug":"university-of-kragujevac-QWPM","affiliationID":"22460"},{"family":"Jovanović","given":"Ivan","affiliation":"University of Kragujevac","authorSlug":"ivan-jovanovic-OeRb04","authorName":"Ivan Jovanović","authorID":"81803378","authorSequenceNumber":3,"affiliationSlug":"university-of-kragujevac-QWPM","affiliationID":"22460"},{"family":"Radosavljevic","given":"Gordana","affiliation":"University of Kragujevac","authorSlug":"gordana-radosavljevic-9O90P2","authorName":"Gordana Radosavljevic","authorID":"7345090","authorSequenceNumber":4,"affiliationSlug":"university-of-kragujevac-QWPM","affiliationID":"22460"},{"family":"Arsenijevic","given":"Nebojsa","affiliation":"University of Kragujevac","authorSlug":"nebojsa-arsenijevic-ANxZXZ","authorName":"Nebojsa Arsenijevic","authorID":"7855593","authorSequenceNumber":5,"affiliationSlug":"university-of-kragujevac-QWPM","affiliationID":"22460"},{"family":"Lukic","given":"Miodrag L.","affiliation":"University of Kragujevac","authorSlug":"miodrag-l-lukic-685gnX","authorName":"Miodrag L.

Host susceptibility and the severity of infection are influenced by disruption of the microbiota and the immune response. However, how the microbiota regulates immune responses to mediate CDI outcome remains unclear. Here, we investigated the role of the microbiota-linked cytokine IL-25 during infection. Intestinal IL-25 was suppressed during CDI in humans and mice. Restoration of IL-25 reduced CDI-associated mortality and tissue pathology even though equivalent levels of C. difficile bacteria and toxin remained in the gut. IL-25 protection was mediated by gut eosinophils, as demonstrated by an increase in intestinal eosinophils and a loss of IL-25 protection upon eosinophil depletion. These findings support a mechanism whereby the induction of IL-25-mediated eosinophilia can reduce host mortality during active CDI. This work may provide targets for future development of microbial or immune-based therapies.","authors":[{"family":"Buonomo","given":"Erica L.","affiliation":"University of Virginia","authorSlug":"erica-l-buonomo-9b1pNb","authorName":"Erica L.

Although a cold environment is the physiologic stimulus for inducing beige fat in mice and humans, the events that lead from the sensing of cold to the development of beige fat remain poorly understood. Here, we identify the efferent beige fat thermogenic circuit, consisting of eosinophils, type 2 cytokines interleukin (IL)-4/13 and alternatively activated macrophages. Genetic loss of eosinophils or IL-4/13 signaling impairs cold-induced biogenesis of beige fat. Mechanistically, macrophages recruited to cold-stressed subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT) undergo alternative activation to induce tyrosine hydroxylase expression and catecholamine production, factors required for browning of scWAT. Conversely, administration of IL-4 to thermoneutral mice increases beige fat mass and thermogenic capacity to ameliorate pre-established obesity. Together, our findings have uncovered the efferent circuit controlling biogenesis of beige fat and provide support for its targeting to treat obesity.","authors":[{"family":"Qiu","given":"Yifu","affiliation":"University of California, San Francisco","authorSlug":"yifu-qiu-n15v8D","authorName":"Yifu Qiu","authorID":"32615577","authorSequenceNumber":1,"affiliationSlug":"university-of-california-san-francisco-w1Ry","affiliationID":"12272"},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Khoa D.","affiliation":"University of California, San Francisco","authorSlug":"khoa-d-nguyen-N802GN","authorName":"Khoa D.

To understand the mechanism responsible for the insulin resistance in these mice, we conducted hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps in awake fatless and wild type littermates before the development of diabetes and examined insulin action and signaling in muscle and liver. We found the fatless mice to be severely insulinresistant, which could be attributed to defects in insulin action in muscle and liver. Both of these abnormalities were associated with defects in insulin activation of insulin receptor substrate-1 and -2-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity and a 2-fold increase in muscle and liver triglyceride content. We also show that upon transplantation of fat tissue into these mice, triglyceride content in muscle and liver returned to normal as does insulin signaling and action. In conclusion, these results suggest that the development of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes may be due to alterations in the partitioning of fat between the adipocyte and muscle/liver leading to accumulation of triglyceride in the latter tissues with subsequent impairment of insulin signaling and action.","authors":[{"family":"Kim","given":"Jason K.","affiliation":"Yale University","authorSlug":"jason-k-kim-vdg5aJ","authorName":"Jason K.

Much of this energy is stored in the form of triacylglycerol (TAG) within lipid droplets, which are present most abundantly in adipocytes and which, in turn, accumulate in depots such as subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue in mice and humans. TAG in lipid droplets is mobilized during starvation by lipase-catalyzed hydrolysis (lipolysis) to release energy in the forms of glycerol and free fatty acids, providing fuel to other cell types such as muscle and liver. Previous work investigating formation of lipid droplets and regulation of lipolysis has elucidated the importance of lipid dropletassociated proteins for these processes ( 1, 2 ). Based on shared sequence homology, one set of lipid droplet proteins is grouped as the perilipin-adipophilin-tail interacting protein 47 (PAT/TIP47) family of proteins ( 3 ). PAT-related proteins are functionally conserved from mammals to lower organisms such as Drosophila and Dictyostelium spp ( 4 ). In Drosophila , two PAT domain proteins are encoded by the Lsdp1 and Lsd2 genes. Drosophila loss-of-function Lsd2 mutants are lean, whereas Lsd2 overexpression causes obesity ( 5 ). In mammals, PAT proteins can be divided into exchangeable TAG-associated PAT proteins (EPATs) or constitutively TAG-associated PAT proteins (CPATs). EPATs include the TIP47/perilipin-3 (PLIN3), S3-12/PLIN4, and Abstract The lipid droplet-associated fat specifi c protein 27 (FSP27) suppresses lipolysis and thereby enhances triglyceride accumulation in adipocytes. We and others have recently found FSP27 to be a remarkably short-lived protein (half-life, 15 min) due to its rapid ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that lipolytic agents such as tumor necrosis factor-␣ (TNF-␣ ) and isoproterenol modulate FSP27 levels to regulate FFA release. Consistent with this concept, we showed that the lipolytic actions of TNF-␣ , interleukin-1 ␤ (IL-1 ␤ ), and IFN-␥ are accompanied by marked decreases in FSP27 expression and lipid droplet size in mouse adipocytes. Similar depletion of FSP27 using short interfering RNA (siRNA) mimicked the lipolysis-enhancing effect of TNF-␣ , while maintaining stable FSP27 levels using expression of hemagglutinin epitopetagged FSP27 blocked TNF-␣ -mediated lipolysis. In contrast, we show the robust lipolytic action of isoproterenol is paradoxically associated with increases in FSP27 levels and a delayed degradation rate corresponding to decreased ubiquitination. This catecholamine-mediated increase in FSP27 abundance, probably a feedback mechanism for restraining excessive lipolysis by catecholamines, is mimicked by forskolin or 8-bromo-cAMP treatment and is prevented by the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor KT5720 or by PKA depletion using siRNA. Taken together, these data identify the regulation of FSP27 as an important intermediate in the mechanism of lipolysis in adipocytes in response to TNF-␣ and isoproterenol. -Ranjit, S","authors":[{"family":"Ranjit","given":"Srijana","affiliation":"University of Massachusetts Medical School","authorSlug":"srijana-ranjit-jX534y","authorName":"Srijana Ranjit","authorID":"14107537","authorSequenceNumber":1,"affiliationSlug":"university-of-massachusetts-medical-school-Qkx","affiliationID":"260"},{"family":"Boutet","given":"Emilie","affiliation":"University of Massachusetts Medical School","authorSlug":"emilie-boutet-vyMG23","authorName":"Emilie Boutet","authorID":"9832653","authorSequenceNumber":2,"affiliationSlug":"university-of-massachusetts-medical-school-Qkx","affiliationID":"260"},{"family":"Gandhi","given":"Pallavi","affiliation":"University of Massachusetts Medical School","authorSlug":"pallavi-gandhi-MlPPNm","authorName":"Pallavi Gandhi","authorID":"16649396","authorSequenceNumber":3,"affiliationSlug":"university-of-massachusetts-medical-school-Qkx","affiliationID":"260"},{"family":"Prot","given":"Matthieu","affiliation":"University of Massachusetts Medical School","authorSlug":"matthieu-prot-Vr6vGE","authorName":"Matthieu Prot","authorID":"102839282","authorSequenceNumber":4,"affiliationSlug":"university-of-massachusetts-medical-school-Qkx","affiliationID":"260"},{"family":"Tamori","given":"Yoshikazu","affiliation":"Kobe University","authorSlug":"yoshikazu-tamori-WGr3ag","authorName":"Yoshikazu Tamori","authorID":"9831292","authorSequenceNumber":5,"affiliationSlug":"kobe-university-jjG5","affiliationID":"18337"},{"family":"Chawla","given":"Anil","affiliation":"University of Massachusetts Medical School","authorSlug":"anil-chawla-WxWA2J","authorName":"Anil Chawla","authorID":"13735848","authorSequenceNumber":6,"affiliationSlug":"university-of-massachusetts-medical-school-Qkx","affiliationID":"260"},{"family":"Greenberg","given":"Andrew S.","affiliation":"Tufts University","authorSlug":"andrew-s-greenberg-rxMPjw","authorName":"Andrew S.

Adipose tissue functions as a key endocrine organ by releasing multiple bioactive substances, known as adipose-derived secreted factors or adipokines, that have pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory activities. Dysregulated production or secretion of these adipokines owing to adipose tissue dysfunction can contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity-linked complications.

Recent evidence has shown that large numbers of TAMs are attracted to and retained in avascular and necrotic areas, where they are exposed to tumor hypoxia. At these sites, TAMs appear to undergo marked phenotypic changes with activation of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors, dramatically upregulating the expression of a large number of genes encoding mitogenic, proangiogenic and prometastatic cytokines and enzymes. As a consequence, high TAMs density has been correlated with increased tumor growth and angiogenesis in various tumor types. Since hypoxia is a hallmark feature of malignant tumors and hypoxic tumor cells are relatively resistant to radio-and chemotherapy, these areas have become a target for novel forms of anticancer therapy. These include hypoxiatargeted gene therapy in which macrophages are armed with therapeutic genes that are activated by hypoxia-responsive promoter elements. This restricts transgene expression to hypoxic areas, where the gene product is then released and acts on neighboring hypoxic tumor cells or proliferating blood vessels. In this way, the responses of macrophages to tumor hypoxia can be exploited to deliver potent antitumor agents to these poorly vascularized, and thus largely inaccessible, areas of tumors.

The growth of GBM is also associated with a marked inflammation partially characterized by an accumulation of macrophage (MΦ) of the M2 phenotype. However, the transition between M1 MΦ (antitumoral) and M2 MΦ (protumoral) phenotypes is a dynamic process. We made the assumption that oxygen (O2) availability could be a major regulator of this transition and that the intratumoral O2 gradient is of importance. We evaluated, in vivo, the impact of hypoxia on MΦ tropism and polarization in two models of human GBM, well differentiated by their degree of hypoxia. MΦ migration in the tumor was more pronounced in the more hypoxic tumor of the two GBM models. In the more hypoxic of the models, we have shown that MΦ migrated at the tumor site only when hypoxia takes place. We also demonstrated that the acquisition of the M2 phenotype was clearly an evolving phenomenon with hypoxia as the major trigger for this transition. In support of these in vivo finding, M0 but also M1 MΦ cultured in moderate or severe hypoxia displayed a phenotype close to that of M2 MΦ whose phenotype was further reinforced by severe hypoxia. These results highlight the role of hypoxia in the aggressiveness of GBM, in part, by transforming MΦ such that a protumoral activity is expressed.","authors":[{"family":"Leblond","given":"M.M.","authorSlug":"m-m-leblond-38R2GJ","authorName":"M.M.

This cell population, termed processed lipoaspirate (PLA) cells, can be isolated from human lipoaspirates and, like MSCs, differentiate toward the osteogenic, adipogenic, myogenic, and chondrogenic lineages. To confirm whether adipose tissue contains stem cells, the PLA population and multiple clonal isolates were analyzed using several molecular and biochemical approaches. PLA cells expressed multiple CD marker antigens similar to those observed on MSCs. Mesodermal lineage induction of PLA cells and clones resulted in the expression of multiple lineage-specific genes and proteins. Furthermore, biochemical analysis also confirmed lineage-specific activity. In addition to mesodermal capacity, PLA cells and clones differentiated into putative neurogenic cells, exhibiting a neuronal-like morphology and expressing several proteins consistent with the neuronal phenotype. Finally, PLA cells exhibited unique characteristics distinct from those seen in MSCs, including differences in CD marker profile and gene expression.","authors":[{"family":"Zuk","given":"Patricia A.","affiliation":"University of California, Los Angeles","authorSlug":"patricia-a-zuk-WGwQR1","authorName":"Patricia A.

These fragments, or ‘reads’, can be used to measure levels of gene expression and to identify novel splice variants of genes. However, current software for aligning RNA-Seq data to a genome relies on known splice junctions and cannot identify novel ones. TopHat is an efficient read-mapping algorithm designed to align reads from an RNA-Seq experiment to a reference genome without relying on known splice sites.Results: We mapped the RNA-Seq reads from a recent mammalian RNA-Seq experiment and recovered more than 72% of the splice junctions reported by the annotation-based software from that study, along with nearly 20 000 previously unreported junctions. The TopHat pipeline is much faster than previous systems, mapping nearly 2.2 million reads per CPU hour, which is sufficient to process an entire RNA-Seq experiment in less than a day on a standard desktop computer. We describe several challenges unique to ab initio splice site discovery from RNA-Seq reads that will require further algorithm development.Availability: TopHat is free, open-source software available from http://tophat.cbcb.umd.eduContact: cole@cs.umd.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","authors":[{"family":"Trapnell","given":"Cole","affiliation":"University of Maryland, College Park","authorSlug":"cole-trapnell-wb9XKL","authorName":"Cole Trapnell","authorID":"8885272","authorSequenceNumber":1,"affiliationSlug":"university-of-maryland-college-park-G3YK","affiliationID":"2613"},{"family":"Pachter","given":"Lior","affiliation":"University of Maryland, College Park","authorSlug":"lior-pachter-G5yZdA","authorName":"Lior Pachter","authorID":"8878157","authorSequenceNumber":2,"affiliationSlug":"university-of-maryland-college-park-G3YK","affiliationID":"2613"},{"family":"Salzberg","given":"Steven L.","affiliation":"University of Maryland, College Park","authorSlug":"steven-l-salzberg-9bPOnP9","authorName":"Steven L.

We introduce an algorithm for transcript assembly coupled with a statistical model for RNA-Seq experiments that produces estimates of abundances. Our algorithms are implemented in an open source software program called Cufflinks. To test Cufflinks, we sequenced and analyzed more than 430 million paired 75bp RNA-Seq reads from a mouse myoblast cell line representing a differentiation time series. We detected 13,692 known transcripts and 3,724 previously unannotated ones, 62% of which are supported by independent expression data or by homologous genes in other species. Analysis of transcript expression over the time series revealed complete switches in the dominant transcription start site (TSS) or splice-isoform in 330 genes, along with more subtle shifts in a further 1,304 genes. These dynamics suggest substantial regulatory flexibility and complexity in this well-studied model of muscle development.","authors":[{"family":"Trapnell","given":"Cole","affiliation":"University of Maryland, College Park","authorSlug":"cole-trapnell-wb9XKL","authorName":"Cole Trapnell","authorID":"8885272","authorSequenceNumber":1,"affiliationSlug":"university-of-maryland-college-park-G3YK","affiliationID":"2613"},{"family":"Williams","given":"Brian A.","affiliation":"California Institute of Technology","authorSlug":"brian-a-williams-623WzM","authorName":"Brian A.

Specific sphingolipids, such as ceramide, glucosylceramide, and ganglioside GM3, have been implicated in various aspects of insulin resistance, because they have been shown to modify several steps in the insulin signaling pathway, such as phosphorylation of either protein kinase B (Akt) or of the insulin receptor. We now explore the role of the ceramide acyl chain length in insulin signaling by using a ceramide synthase 2 (CerS2) null mouse, which is unable to synthesize very long acyl chain (C22-C24) ceramides. CerS2 null mice exhibited glucose intolerance despite normal insulin secretion from the pancreas. Both insulin receptor and Akt phosphorylation were abrogated in liver, but not in adipose tissue or in skeletal muscle. The lack of insulin receptor phosphorylation in liver correlated with its inability to translocate into detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs). Moreover, DRMs in CerS2 null mice displayed properties significantly different from those in wild-type mice, suggesting that the altered sphingolipid acyl chain length directly affects insulin receptor translocation and subsequent signaling. Conclusion: We conclude that the sphingolipid acyl chain composition of liver regulates insulin signaling by modifying insulin receptor translocation into membrane microdomains.

In mice, the normal lung contains resident eosinophils (rEos), but their function has not been characterized. Here, we have reported that steady-state pulmonary rEos are IL-5-independent parenchymal Siglec-FintCD62L+CD101lo cells with a ring-shaped nucleus. During house dust mite-induced airway allergy, rEos features remained unchanged, and rEos were accompanied by recruited inflammatory eosinophils (iEos), which were defined as IL-5-dependent peribronchial Siglec-FhiCD62L-CD101hi cells with a segmented nucleus. Gene expression analyses revealed a more regulatory profile for rEos than for iEos, and correspondingly, mice lacking lung rEos showed an increase in Th2 cell responses to inhaled allergens. Such elevation of Th2 responses was linked to the ability of rEos, but not iEos, to inhibit the maturation, and therefore the pro-Th2 function, of allergen-loaded DCs. Finally, we determined that the parenchymal rEos found in nonasthmatic human lungs (Siglec-8+CD62L+IL-3Rlo cells) were phenotypically distinct from the iEos isolated from the sputa of eosinophilic asthmatic patients (Siglec-8+CD62LloIL-3Rhi cells), suggesting that our findings in mice are relevant to humans.
